🎥 Project Walkthrough (3-Minute Demo)
[Watch Here] (Comming Soon)


## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world **enterprise IT Help Desk environment** using:

- **osTicket (Ubuntu Linux)**
- **Windows Server Active Directory**
- **Windows 11 Domain-Joined Client**
- **UTM Virtualization (Apple Silicon)**

The lab demonstrates how IT support teams receive, triage, escalate, and resolve technical issues involving:

- Active Directory user management
- Account lockouts and password resets
- Group-based access control
- Cloud identity troubleshooting
- Endpoint and network issues

This mirrors real Tier 1 / Tier 2 support workflows used in corporate environments.
